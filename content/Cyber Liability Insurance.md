## Cyber Liability Insurance

### Current insurance arrangements

Your current cyber liability insurance policy covers you for up to £250,000, but the market standard is now £1,000,000. This is because cybercrime is on the rise, and ransoms are often demanded for this amount. We recommend that you increase your limit to £1,000,000 and we also suggest that we seek a full cyber quote from CFC incorporating crime, to maximize your protection.

### Cyber Insurance Terms

Cyber liability insurance in the UK, like in many other countries, involves a variety of terms and concepts that policyholders should understand. This type of insurance is designed to protect businesses and individuals from the financial consequences of cyberattacks and data breaches. Below, I'll explain some key insurance terms related to cyber liability insurance in the UK:

Cyber Liability Insurance: This is a type of insurance policy that covers losses and liabilities associated with cyber-related risks, such as data breaches, hacking, and other cyberattacks.

First-Party Coverage: This aspect of the policy covers the insured's own costs and losses resulting from a cyber incident. It typically includes expenses like breach response, business interruption, and data recovery.

Third-Party Coverage: This aspect of the policy covers liability claims from third parties, such as customers or business partners, arising from a cyber incident. It may include costs related to legal defence and settlements.

Data Breach: A data breach is an unauthorized access or release of sensitive or confidential information. Cyber liability insurance often covers the costs associated with responding to and mitigating the effects of a data breach.

Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands a ransom for its release. Cyber liability insurance may cover the ransom payment and associated costs.

Phishing: Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. Coverage may include losses resulting from phishing attacks.

Social Engineering Fraud: This term refers to situations where cybercriminals manipulate individuals or employees into transferring money or sensitive information. Cyber liability policies may cover losses due to social engineering fraud.

Business Interruption: This coverage helps compensate for financial losses incurred when a cyber incident disrupts normal business operations.

Notification Costs: When a data breach occurs, organizations often need to notify affected individuals and authorities. This coverage can help with the expenses associated with notifying impacted parties.

Cyber Extortion: Coverage for cyber extortion includes payments made to cybercriminals who threaten to release sensitive data or launch an attack unless a ransom is paid.

Incident Response: This covers expenses related to hiring cybersecurity experts, conducting forensic investigations, and managing the aftermath of a cyber incident.

Regulatory Fines and Penalties: Cyber liability insurance may help cover fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities for non-compliance with data protection regulations.

Subrogation: If the insurer pays a claim, they may have the right to sue the responsible party to recover their expenses. Subrogation can affect who is ultimately held financially responsible for a cyber incident.

Policy Limits: The maximum amount the insurance policy will pay for covered losses. Policyholders should carefully consider their coverage limits to ensure they have adequate protection.

Deductible: The amount the policyholder is responsible for paying before the insurance coverage kicks in. A higher deductible can lead to lower premium costs.

Exclusions: These are specific circumstances or events that are not covered by the insurance policy. It's essential to understand what is excluded from your coverage.

Coverage Extensions: Some policies offer optional or additional coverage extensions that can be tailored to specific needs, such as coverage for reputational harm or cyberterrorism.

When considering cyber liability insurance in the UK, it's crucial to work closely with an experienced insurance agent or broker who can help you understand the policy terms and select the coverage that best suits your organization's needs and risk profile. Additionally, policy wording and terms can vary between insurance providers, so a careful review of the policy documentation is essential.
